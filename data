This dataset, titled SciData22: Stereo Scientific Text Reuse, is hosted on GitHub and provides a comprehensive resource for studying text reuse in scientific literature. It contains 91 million instances of text reuse, including minimal to extensive verbatim overlaps, extracted from 4.2 million open-access publications. The dataset is ideal for exploring patterns of scientific writing, plagiarism detection, and semantic text analysis.

The data was compiled by the Webis research group and is presented in a structured format for easy use in machine learning and computational linguistics applications. It is accompanied by detailed metadata, including publication IDs, text reuse percentages, and timestamps.
